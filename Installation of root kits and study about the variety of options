A rootkit is a program or a collection of malicious software tools that give a threat actor remote access to and control over a computer or other system. Although this type of software has some legitimate uses, such as providing remote end-user support, most rootkits open a backdoor on victims' systems to introduce malicious software -- including viruses, ransomware, keylogger programs or other types of malware -- or to use the system for further network security attacks. Rootkits often attempt to prevent detection of malicious software by deactivating endpoint antimalware and antivirus software.

Rootkits, which can be purchased on the dark web, can be installed during phishing attacks or employed as a social engineering tactic to trick users into giving the rootkits permission to be installed on their systems, often giving remote cybercriminals administrator access to the system. Once installed, a rootkit gives the remote actor access to and control over almost every aspect of the operating system (OS). Older antivirus programs often struggled to detect rootkits, but today, most antimalware programs can scan for and remove rootkits hiding within a system.
